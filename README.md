##  **Purpose**

The purpose of this repository is to complete the objectives of the CMPSC 16 course at UCSB, to:
- Gain experience solving problems with computers
- Expand their beginning knowledge of programming, and learn to apply structured programming techniques
- Learn to write C++ programs in a Unix-like environment"

As specified on the CMPSC 16 class syllabus.

This repository includes my completed versions of the CMPSC 16 homework assignments as posted online at http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~mikec/cs16/assignments/index.html, as an attempt to pre-qualify for CMPSC 24, a class which CMPSC 16 is a pre-requisite.

## **Folders**
The **"CS 16 HW"** folder includes each homework assignment in separate folders. For example, HW Assignment 1 is placed into the "p1" folder, and so on, for a total of 6 assignments.

The **"Personal Projects"** folder include a few programs I previously wrote in Java into C++, as well as incorporating various skillsets in C++ in programs to match the requirements of CMPSC 16. Each program's functions are described in comments at the start.
